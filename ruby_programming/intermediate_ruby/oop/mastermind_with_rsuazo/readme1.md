## Testing the Easy way, with RSpec

I don't really want to do this right now....I want just build. So i'll keep doing that. when I absolutely want to use RSpec, I'll return to it. 

## slow your brain, and return to the `Game` class
Ok, so now, what do I know? 

I know that I can start a game by getting input from the user, and that I'm getting good input, either an `m` or a `b`.

Ok..then what? 

Well, then the game needs to go on....

Yeah...and....

ummmm, i'm not sure.

Yeah you are. You do know what needs to happen, we need to either: 

1. make the code, or 
2. break the code

yeah, but those are two very different things!  

That's ok! Let's think about them a little bit. 

Ok...but How do we get from the `#get_input` method to the "making" or "breaking" of the code? 

Hmm.....that's a strange question. 

So the two things are "connected"....there is a link between the `#get_input` method and the `making` or `breaking`....

...but before I go over that....I want to point something out: We've already started our next two methods.

#### What?! Two methods?! We just finished one! And we already "forgot" about a second one! Now you're talking about 2 more methods?! That's gonna mean we'll have 4 methods! I can't keep all this straight!

Again, slow your brain down.

### Stop saying that! 

Ok...but again, try to stop panicing. We're writing things. We're making things. We're sort of keeping it all togheter, but we're creating and writing, so we don't really need to keep it all together. The computer is storing things for us, and we simply get to revert back to what we've arleady written, and use the code we write to build more...  

I don't know that I follow, but I don't really know what the other two methods are that we now need to write, or have already started. 

I'll tell you, they're `make` and `break`.  Or as you should get used to seeing them: `#make` or `#break`... which is like a short hand for writing `Game#make` or `Game#break`...
