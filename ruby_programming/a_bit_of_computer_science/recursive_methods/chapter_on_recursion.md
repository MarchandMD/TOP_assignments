#The Bastards Book of Ruby: Chapter on Recursion
So, before I dig into one of these articles, I like to predict what it is I might see, or what I might be reading about. 

But I've already read this article, so i feel like I may have some idea what it's going to be about. 

But what I've learned is that I've developed a sort of intellectual crutch for my reading comprehension. I need to write while I read. I need to parse the thing that I'm reading. So while I've already read the article, not much of it was absorbed by me. I need to actually pull it apart, word for word, idea by idea. 

But my guess is that I'll be reading about the idea of "Recursion" generally, and how to identify a problem that may need recursion...though Im not so sure about that. 

I mean, if recursion is a design pattern for an algorithm........ then how does one identify when a designed pattern is suitable for a given problem or issue? And will the pattern follow a verbatim formula? 

I mean, that's what's sort of difficult about this idea...is that it's a topic about an idea that doesn't have a specific means of application. There may be some general concepts regarding how to structure a method to model a "recursive design pattern"...but the idea of design patterns or algorithms are a much larger idea...and I think there are several 'general' design patterns. I guess without being more exposed to higher-level designing issues...it's difficult to understand the utility of a design pattern such as 'recursion'....but it seems to be a concept that the curriculum is driving home...or stressing...so I'll "eat my veggies" so to speak...

##The Article
The first thing I notice is the title: 

#### Recursion
#####A divide-and-conquer design pattern

So the next obvious thing I want to point out is this: this design pattern has a name. "divide-and-conquer". I know that in some of the other introductory articles there might have been a link to a wiki article that suggested some other popular design patterns. I think I'll take a look for that article, and see what I can find. (so the first thing I'm doing with this article is leaving it to go look at other articles...)

So there are some other "types" of design patterns. But I think what I am thinking of...is the list of implementation issues and advantages listed on the Wikipedia page RE divide-and-conquer algorithms. 

With that said, there definitely are other types, and those other types exist. But they aren't necessarily pointed out in TOP curriculum/articles. 

And I think I may want to go back and dig a little deeper into this Wikipedia page RE the Divide-and-Conquer algorithm. But my focus right now is the Bastard's Book of Ruby...so i'll keep going forward with that. 

>while it is fun and challenging to write recursive procedures, it's rare to find situations in which a loop can't do the same thing â€“ sometimes faster.

So right away the author is giving me some fodder to have some disdain for the idea of recursion. I mean, it's a certain strucutre of an algorithm...but so are loops. And loops might be just as effective, if not faster. So then why am I so concerned with the recursive algorithm? Why is a design pattern necessary? 


I mean, i think the idea of design patterns is a step up in the abstraction world...I think that having a grasp on the language is one thing...but being able to think about programs at another level is another step in the progress of program design. 

Will it make writing programs easier? 

I mean, I want to argue that the only thing that'll make writing programs easier is writing more programs. But that requries taking time to plan...a litle bit...yeah? Maybe. 

back to the article....

I don't really know what is meant by this "divide-and-conquer" idea...and I know it comes from a different article...

And so since my curiosity keeps getting snagged by the phrase 'divide-and-conquer' i'm going to spend some more time with the other article. 

# 1/08
I want to dig into divide and conquer...I'm just not so sure about where to go with it...because the things I look for a little too esoteric for me...or they don't give me the kind of knowledge I'm looking for. I suppose I could keep digging...but I want to move on with the articles I'm looking at. And maybe continue to look for resources...but that's kind of the idea...TheOdinProject is the resource for good sources....so I'll dig into this Bastard's Book of Ruby...After I explore some other free eBooks
