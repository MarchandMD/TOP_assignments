          <p class="ruleNotes">
            (Note) Boarding is the action where a player pushes, trips or body checks an opponent causing them to go dangerously into the boards. This includes: Accelerating through the check to a player who is in a vulnerable position, driving an opponent excessively into the boards with no focus on or intent to play the puck, or any check delivered for the purpose of punishment or intimidation that causes the opponent to go unnecessarily and excessively into the boards.
          </p>

          Rule 604 | Body Checking (Body Contact Categories & Non-Check Adult Classifications)
        </button>
        <div class='accordionPanel'>
          <p class='ruleNotes'>
            (Note 1) For the purpose of this rule, an illegal body check is defined as when a player makes a deliberate physical contact with the opponent using overt hip, shoulder, arm or torso action. This includes physically impeding the opponent's progress for the purpose of physically forcing the opponent off the puck and with no effort to legally play the puck.
          </p>
          <p class='ruleNotes'>
            (Note 2) For the purpose of this rule, USA Hockey has identified two different categories of play. They are Body Contact (where Body Checking is prohibited) and Body Checking (where a legal body check is permissable). Please refer to the Glossary for specific definitions of Body Contact and a Body Check.
          </p>
          <p class='ruleDefinition'>
            (a) Body checking is prohibited in the 12 & under youth age classification and below and all Girls’/Women’s age classifications. These levels would be considered the Body Contact Category of play.
          </p>
          <p class='ruleDefinition'>
            Body checking is also prohibited in all non-check Adult classifications.
          </p>
          <p class='ruleDefinition'>
            (b) Anytime a team from a Body Contact category (see sub-section (a) above) plays a team from a Body Checking category, checking shall be prohibited under this rule. 
          </p>
          <p class='ruleDefinition'>
            (c) A minor or major penalty shall be assessed to a player who body checks an opponent in a Body Contact category or non-check Adult classification.
          </p>
          <p class='ruleNotes'>
            (Note) Body Contact hockey does not mean “no contact.” There will be legal body contact (see Glossary) within the rules in Body Contact categories. Legal body contact shall not be penalized under this rule. However, deliberate physical contact with an opponent, with no effort to legally play the puck, shall be penalized. 
          </p>
          <p class='ruleDefinition'>
            (d) A major plus a game misconduct penalty shall be assessed to any player who injures an opponent with a body check in a Body Contact category or non-check Adult classification.

          </p>
          <p class='ruleDefinition'>(a) Any player whose stick is broken must drop his stick prior to participating in the play. A player or goalkeeper shall be allowed reasonable time to be aware that the stick is broken. A minor penalty for an equipment violation shall be assessed for participating in play with a broken stick.</p>
          <p class='ruleDefinition'>(b) A replacement stick for any player who is no longer in possession of a stick may only be obtained from the player’s bench or from a teammate on the ice. A minor penalty for an equipment violation shall be assessed to a player who receives a replacement stick illegally, unless the team is assessed a bench minor penalty under Rule 601(b.4) Throwing Articles into the Playing Area. In this instance, the player receiving the thrown stick shall not be penalized.</p>
          <p class='ruleDefinition'>(c) A goalkeeper whose stick is broken may not go to the players’ bench for a replacement during a stoppage of play, but must receive his stick from a teammate.

          <p class='ruleNotes'>(Note) Charging is the action where a player takes more than two strides or travels an excessive distance to accelerate through a body check for the purpose of punishing the opponent. This includes skating or leaving one's feet (jumping) into the opponent to deliver a check, accelerating through a check for the purpose of punishing the opponent, or skating a great distance for the purpose of delivering a check with excessive force.</p>

          <p class='ruleDefinition'>(c) A minor plus a misconduct or a major plus a game misconduct penalty shall be assessed to a player who body checks or charges a goalkeeper while the goalkeeper is within his goal crease or privileged area.</p>
          <p class='ruleDefinition'>(d) A goalkeeper is NOT “fair game” because he is outside his privileged area. A penalty for interference or charging should be called in every case where an opposing player makes unnecessary contact with a goalkeeper. Likewise, Referees should be alert to penalize goalkeepers for any infractions they commit in the vicinity of the goal.</p>
          <p class='ruleNotes'>(Note 1) For the purpose of this rule, any accidental or unavoidable contact that occurs with the goalkeeper shall be penalized under the Interference rule. Any deliberate body contact or check that is delivered to the goalkeeper shall be penalized as Charging.</p>
          <p class='ruleNotes'>(Note 2) The goalkeeper’s “Privileged Area” is an area outlined by connecting the end zone face-off spots with an imaginary line and imaginary lines from each face-off spot running perpendicular to the end boards.</p>
          <p class='ruleDefinition'>(e) A match penalty for attempt to injure or deliberate injury to an opponent may also be assessed for Charging.</p>
